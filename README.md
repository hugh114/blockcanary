# BlockCanary [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.moduth/blockcanary-android/badge.svg?style=flat)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.moduth/blockcanary-android)
A transparent ui-block detection library for Android, app only needs one-line-code to setup. Author: [markzhai](https://github.com/markzhai), [Contributors](https://github.com/moduth/blockcanary#contributors)

The naming is to pay respect to the great library [LeakCanary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary), ui-related codes are modified from leakcanary's ui part.

# Getting started

You may choose how to assemble them as you like.

```gradle
dependencies {
    // most often used way, enable notification to notify block event
    compile 'com.github.moduth:blockcanary-android:1.2.1'

    // this way you only enable BlockCanary in debug package
    // debugCompile 'com.github.moduth:blockcanary-android:1.2.1'
    // releaseCompile 'com.github.moduth:blockcanary-no-op:1.2.1'
}
```

PS: As this library uses `getMainLooper().setMessageLogging()`, please check if you also set that in your app. (check related issue https://github.com/moduth/blockcanary/issues/27)

# Usage

Maximum log count is set to 100, you can rewrite it in your app `int.xml`.
```xml
<integer name="block_canary_max_stored_count">100</integer>
```

```java
public class DemoApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        ...
        // Do it on main process
        BlockCanary.install(this, new AppBlockCanaryContext()).start();
    }
}
```

Implement BlockCanaryContext contextï¼š
```java
public class AppBlockCanaryContext extends BlockCanaryContext {
    // override to provide context like app qualifier, uid, network type, block threshold, log save path

    // this is default block threshold, you can set it by phone's performance
    @Override
    public int getConfigBlockThreshold() {
        return 500;
    }

    // if set true, notification will be shown, else only write log file
    @Override
    public boolean isNeedDisplay() {
        return BuildConfig.DEBUG;
    }

    // path to save log file
    @Override
    public String getLogPath() {
        return "/blockcanary/performance";
    }
}
```

# How does it work?
Blog in Chinese: [BlockCanary](http://blog.zhaiyifan.cn/2016/01/16/BlockCanaryTransparentPerformanceMonitor/).

Principle flow picture:

![flow](art/flow.png "flow")

1. `BlockCanary.install()` initializes context and internal data structures.
2. `BlockCanary.start()` starts monitor by `Looper.getMainLooper().setMessageLogging(mMainLooperPrinter);`
3. `ThreadStackSampler` and `CpuSampler` start catching thread stack and cpu data.
4. Each time a message dispatch costs time over that set by `BlockCanaryContext.getConfigBlockThreshold`, it triggers a block notify.
5. Write log file with data for analysis.
6. If `BlockCanaryContext.isNeedDisplay` is true, a notification is shown, developer can click and check directly.
